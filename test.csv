5,"( CNN ) — Your Thanksgiving table may smaller year , still full squashes , corn pudding , turkey cranberry sauce , thank Native Americans -- foods indigenous . But apple pie international -- apples Kazakhstan pie part England . It 's hard define `` American food '' yet many historians tried . Yale Professor Paul Freedman one last year published `` American Cuisine How It Got That Way . '' `` The exuberance American dining saving grace , '' says Freedman . `` ... Despite fact many things , know , good . '' Americans get pretty excited food , much world , historians like Freedman say actually share key culinary traits uniquely American origin 're talking throwing everything deep fry . Fast food always American hallmark , even though 're eating less days , 're McDonald 's cheese-in-a-can 've even exported American ways eating . Yes , France . You 've learned thing two us , . To understand tastebuds common , let 's look five key developments history America 's eating habits . 1 ) The good old days sugar healthy Up late 1800s , people preferred eat foods filled . Dairy , meat , hominy , oatmeal sugar staples -- vegetables , much . Vitamins would n't fully appreciated 20th century . `` They n't like spices think created indigestion distraction actual food , '' says Freedman , noted spices considered `` food poor . '' Historian Sarah Lohman says n't quite bland sounds . Mary Randolph 's 1824 cookbook , `` The Virginia House-Wife , '' calls chili peppers . `` It 's really , really influenced indigenous cultures , particular , enslaved people come Caribbean , enslaved people come Africa African descendants , '' says Lohman . 2 ) Food travels around country In 19th century , New Englanders eating brown breads brown stuffing , South pork , molasses , greens , griddled cornmeal corn breads . Black cooks hand cuisine beginning . From South North , contribution ubiquitous significance long overlooked . Just one example story ice cream . James Hemmings , Thomas Jefferson 's enslaved chef , traveled family France , learned art making ice cream brought back US along copper cookware , European-style mac ' n ' cheese French fries . Historian Jessica Harris lead curator exhibition `` African/American : Making Nation 's Table '' Museum Food Drink New York City . She said Black chefs traveled early aristocrats left South summer homes places like Newport . Later Black Pullman operators moved west along railroads , bringing families familiar food . After Civil War , Great Migration brought Black cuisine everywhere . `` It 's looking history , looking culture , looking things science spyglass food , '' said Harris . `` And 's great spyglass 's one everybody shares . '' Then late 19th century , 's New England 's filling , yet perhaps monochromatic , food comes forefront . 3 ) The pure joy home economics class Scientific ideas around food always existed , late 1800s , people began prioritize invisible components food learning , avoid illnesses like scurvy , beriberi pellagra . Vegetables became bit important -- albeit cooked long periods time . A woman 's kitchen became laboratory cookbooks study materials . What thought `` nutrition '' incredibly important yet women could n't learn cook Mom , want . `` The idea n't everything way mother , first , drudgery , '' says Laura Shapiro , historian writes women food . `` It really hard work n't modern . '' Starting 1890 , Fannie Farmer began turning hearty New England dishes sophisticated meals , though sometimes meant plate white brown . The textbook wrote later became `` The Fannie Farmer Cookbook '' popularity lasted decades , usurped `` The Joy Cooking '' 1930s . Shapiro says Farmer 's writing rather dry fun . Farmer invented ginger ale salad congeals canned fruit gelatin soda . Her book came right families moving away home base spreading across country . `` You young bride cook new home n't know , '' says Shapiro . `` Once learn , wonderful cooking husband healthy wo n't become alcoholic . '' That 's lot pressure put meatloaf . Thankfully , Americans got help really n't earn . 4 ) When get n't deserve Immigration , migration variety manufacturing start see America really start form eating habits separate us countries . While every country world immigration , America happened large scale early . Historian Sarah Lohman spent years leading tours classes lives immigrants New York City 's Tenement Museum traveled 12 different parts country book , `` Eight Flavors : The Untold Story American Cuisine . '' `` At time domestic science becoming part American food landscape , 's also 're seeing huge influx immigrants Italy Eastern Europe , particularly Jewish immigrants , '' says Lohman . Lohman says Eastern Europeans brought love sour foods , Italians brought garlic . Their food changed reached America , Italians particular opting foods like olive oil aged cheeses . Back Italy , expensive exports , States Italians could afford used liberally . That 's also true Chinese cuisine spread steadily across country prejudice growing Chinese people . Kevin Kim researches history Chinese people Deep South working project continued displacement urban immigrant communities Smithsonian Anacostia Community Museum . `` One contradictions complexities Chinese food early period marked exclusion , '' says Kim . `` It 's marked racism time hunger something exotic yet familiar . '' The Chinese Exclusion Act 1882 aimed keeping Chinese laborers came US plentiful jobs , Act contained exceptions . Merchants owned stores grocery stores exempt later , restaurant owners . The number Chinese restaurants doubled early part 19th century mid-20th century . Kim explains restauranteurs brought Asian flavors cooking methods adapted growing using local ingredients . Broccoli n't used China appears Chinese menus . Chinese cooks living African American Caribbean neighborhoods added collard greens fried chicken menus . Another boom comes immigration opens 1965 , bringing people many parts Asia . While immigration begins melt way American meals , variety came American manufacturing moved like warp speed new era . 5 ) With industrialization comes flavors flavors Processed foods like cake mixes powdered eggs existed great World Wars , reached new levels wars . Innovations like canned frozen foods fed troops en masse still made lightning speed manufacturers needed find new market . So , companies focused attention women home . Grocery stores game : Their produce requires lot manpower much ends getting thrown , unlike rows rows canned tomatoes . `` The food industry wants , day , think cooking incredible drag imposition time , '' says Freedman . `` Otherwise , 'll buy potatoes mash n't really make whole lot money buying potatoes . They make money buying instant mashed potatoes . '' Shapiro says manufacturers created notion women always busy , always running time . So , `` creating world every day , every meal emergency . '' `` Never say women welcomed , '' says Shapiro , railing images portraying happy women ads quick mixes . `` That bullshit . The women put huge resistance . The food industry astonished . '' Decades later people start pack schedules , processed foods still . But instead one tomatoes , Italian-style canned tomatoes , Spanish-style canned tomatoes , even inexplicably , low-sodium canned tomatoes . Should n't low-sodium begin ? Who needs high-sodium canned tomatoes ? `` Variety comes mask idea things processed , '' says Freedman . `` It kind distracts attention fact industrial food loses flavor freshness fact processed . '' American food Now eat many , many things , processed fresh , familiar exotic . We love evidenced massive popularity food television , food magazines , food museums food exhibitions . That 's worldwide phenomenon . `` Most people like eat like come together around food , '' says Catherine Piccoli , Acting President Museum Food Drink . `` But also something allows us learn one another . '' Freedman found research mid-20th century , sheer variety flavors supermarkets astonished people visiting world . Now , variety found everywhere , historians argue started America first . Americans long willing try new things , supermarket eating . `` A hallmark American cuisine variety variety includes exuberance , '' says Freedman . `` Americanization come world , McDonald 's , eclecticism .
